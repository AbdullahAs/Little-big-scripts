# Little big scripts :)
This project contains some Shell and SQL scripts that Iâ€™ve built during previous projects


> [`archive_yesterday_log.sh`} - shell script to archive the log files of yesterday and move them to the log backup dirictory

> [`delete_old_log_batch.sh`] - Ok, this one to delete the old log files after 20 days! it just takes so much space in the server. Runs inside a cron-job.
